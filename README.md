Java code created while in Data Structures and Algorithms

I apologize if this repository is confusing with a lot of similar file names. Submissions were required in this style and I risk file corruption if I attempt to change their project information.

HW 4 files are mostly functional with the exceotion of HW4ConstantTimeQueue.java. I will delete it at some point, but for now it will remain.
